# Classification_of_exercise_from_real_time_data

Description
===========
This is project Classification of exercise from real time data developed by Teng Ma, Qingyuan Jin and Jiaqi Yan. 

In this project, the classification of exercise type from whole dataset and real-time dataset is studied. 
The methodology of 
logistic regression(baseline), SVM, Adaboost, Multilayer Perceptron and Long Short Term Memory networks 
is implemented. After that we demonstrate the classification performance of each model along with our 
experiment. The LSTM model shows the tremendous performance on sequential dataset.
